Lady Lune found you the next morning, but rather than kick you out, she took a liking to you and allowed you to stay on the farm if you worked for your keep. You have been working on the farm ever since.</p><p>Encouraged and fincanced by Lady Lune, you have even returned to college (you dropped out of Hoboken University in New Jersey - as a freshman). You seem to have really turned yourself around. You work days and spend nights in school or at the library where you have become good friends with Monica, the librarian.</p><p>Life was really good... until Robert died. Since losing her husband, Lady Lune has grown more and more distant. You are worried that in time she will lose interest in paying for your schooling - and you still have two years to go. However, with the Duke announcing his proprietors, this could be just your chance to come into some good fortune. It is no secret that you are trying to get on the Duke's goodside. You have been sure to be increasingly helpful around the estate - and always where somebody might notice.</p>",secrets:"<p>You did not <i>drop out</i> of Hoboken College. You were kicked out of school after being arrested for selling drugs to an undercover police officer. You spend only a little time in jail, but it was enough for your family to disown you.

You even grow your own marijuana crop down near the barn by the lake.</p><p>For English class, you are writing a paper on the history of the town. Since Monica is is an amateur historian, you have worked out a deal - she does the research that you need, and you <i>keep her company</i> on lonely nights.</p><p>Monica is no the only one with whom you are having an affair.

You lived in Los Angeles for many years and brought a mental peace to many big name hollywood stars, but you have a strict policy against name-dropping.

It is almost impossible to keep a secret in such a small town and you are proud of the fact that you know everything about everybody. You ahve read every novel by Agatha Christie, Patricia Cornwell, and, of course, Aurthur Conan Doyle (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes).

With a little more research using that new-fangled Internet thing you figured out that the farmer died before mining the gold, and it could still be buried on the land. You called the one nephew you have in real estate to come and buy the farm from Kathryn and sell it to you for a small profit. You like Kathryn, but the thought of such a great deal of money and a life outside this town is too tempting.

You and Vicki are not close at all, so you must get your sexual thrills whatever way you can - a little voyeurism here, an affair there... As for this vacation, it is not really a vacation at all. You are currently on administrative leave from your job as a real estate broker for sexually harassing the office receptionist. To make matters worse, you now have no way to cover up the evidence that you have been skimming money from your real estate transactions (Vicki lives way beyond your means - man, you hate her). You have kept the sexual harassment suit and the skimming from the company a secret from Vicki. You told her that you need money for gambling debts. You had to sell your house to return most of the money to the company, but it isn't enough.

At age 18 you secretly eloped with Sherwin and have lived with him ever since. You do not love Sherwin, but with three kids and no college education, you feel trapped. Sherwin, unfortunately, is an insecure loser. He has a gambling problem, and owes money to some very powerful people. You have a plan to get out of this terrible situation, though.

You and the Duke attended grade school together here in Cedar Grove. Yourself and the Duke, who\u2019s real name is Ernest Hemsworth, were always getting into trouble as children here on the grounds Hemsworth Estate. Evenings were filled with pranks and adventures. Through later school years, you and Ernest even played in polo tournaments which his father hosted each summer month. The two of you were best of friends, that is, until you started getting older. As graduation approached, Ernest was required to be more and more involved in his family\u2019s dealings. He was after all, to become the next Duke.</p><p>As Ernest grew more distant in your later childhood years, naturally you turned to fill your time in the way many other young men do: by chasing love. Soon after graduation, a girl by the name of Julia caught your eye, and within two years the both of you were fast wed. Ernest did make it to your wedding, but the ceremony was the first time you had seen him in months - maybe even since graduation if you remember correctly. At the wedding, it was like the two of you had never been apart: good laughs, good ale, and better company. But since then, Ernest has been as distant as you have ever seen him. Hardly once a year you get together for a polo ride on horseback, and a drink or two in the cigar room before parting ways.</p><p>This banquet is an opportunity to change all that. To rekindle a lost friendship. And... to see if perhaps it is your name written on his will.</p>",secrets:"<p>Marrying Julia was a whirlwind of summer love. But, maybe that\u2019s all it was.
