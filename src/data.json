            "whoYouAre": "<p>You work on Duke Hemsworth's Estate doing odd jobs as needed. Little is known of your past, and you like to keep it that way. A year ago, you were a drifter with no ambition. Packed and ready to hitchhike your way to California, you camped for the night in the Hemsworth's Barn. Lady Lune found you the next morning, but rather than kick you out, she took a liking to you and allowed you to stay on the farm if you worked for your keep. You have been working on the farm ever since.</p><p>Encouraged and fincanced by Lady Lune, you have even returned to college (you dropped out of Hoboken University in New Jersey - as a freshman). You seem to have really turned yourself around. You work days and spend nights in school or at the library where you have become good friends with Monica, the librarian.</p><p>Life was really good... until Robert died. Since losing her husband, Lady Lune has grown more and more distant. You are worried that in time she will lose interest in paying for your schooling - and you still have two years to go. However, with the Duke announcing his proprietors, this could be just your chance to come into some good fortune. It is no secret that you are trying to get on the Duke's goodside. You have been sure to be increasingly helpful around the estate - and always where somebody might notice.</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>You did not <i>drop out</i> of Hoboken College. You were kicked out of school after being arrested for selling drugs to an undercover police officer. You spend only a little time in jail, but it was enough for your family to disown you. With nobody to return to, you headed west - everyone heads west eventually - to make a name for yourself and show them back home that you really <b>are</b> somebody.</p><p>You enjoy your new lifestyle with a cushy job and free education, but you cannot escape the bliss you get from taking drugs and still indulge in them frequently. You even grow your own marijuana crop down near the barn by the lake.</p><p>For English class, you are writing a paper on the history of the town. Since Monica is is an amateur historian, you have worked out a deal - she does the research that you need, and you <i>keep her company</i> on lonely nights.</p><p>Monica is no the only one with whom you are having an affair. While Monica does your homework, you are free for more pleasurable pursuits. The psychiatrist next door seems to like to play when her husband is away. You have seen her bedroom on more than one occasion.</p>"

            "whoYouAre": "<p>Although you do not consider yourself a friend to Lady Lune (just nodding terms as you pass), you live next door to Duke Hemsworth's Estate. You bought your land just about a year ago (the same time as the Benningtons who live a few short miles up the avenue) when a portion of extended lands owned by the Duke were sub-divided and sold.</p><p>You are a retired and psychiatrist. You lived in Los Angeles for many years and brought a mental peace to many big name hollywood stars, but you have a strict policy against name-dropping. While most of you patients droned on and on about their boring problems, you daydreamed about murder and mayhem. Soon you completed a mystery novel that sold very well (just 17 books away form the top-ten best seller list) and allowed you to move to Minnesota and focus on writing a sequel.</p><p>Your husbend is currently overseas on business, but that does not stop you from socializing. You enjoy your newfound fame and often host parties for the cream of the society's crop. In fact, you came to Duke Hemsworth's Estate today to ask if you could use some of Lady Lune's farmland for extra valet parking for your party next week.</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>The novel that made you famous also made you a social outcast in Los Angeles. Your fictional novel about a celebrity murder was assumed by some to be based on fact - facts you were told by your celebrity patients. As rumors of your sources surfaced, your career plunged. Celebrity clients found new psychiatrists and you had no work. Invitations stopped arriving. You were blackballed. You had to move.</p><p>With your husband constantly away, the pressures of social climbing alone can be too much. You like to find relief in the arms of one of the <i>masculine</i> and <i>chiseled</i> groundskeepers next door. But he is not the only one you have been having an affair with! You fell in love with Jarvis Bennington, a friend of the Duke - who is married to his wife, Julia. He has promised to leave Julia for you. He has told you he is working to get a sum of money transferred to hidden accounts so that you might run away together.</p>"

            "whoYouAre": "<p>You are Lady Lune's best friend - who you know as just Kathryn but out of regard of her high position everyone refers to her by her title, <i>Lady</i>. Kathryn often volunteered at the local library where, for the last ten years, you have been the head (and only) librarian. You are unmarried, but have several nieces and nephews on wich you dote almost as much as your fifteen cats.</p><p>Not only are you the town's librarian, but it's historian (and biggest gossip) as well. It is almost impossible to keep a secret in such a small town and you are proud of the fact that you know everything about everybody. You ahve read every novel by Agatha Christie, Patricia Cornwell, and, of course, Aurthur Conan Doyle (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes). Sometimes, on rainy days, you feel like picking up a Stephen King.</p><p>Today, you are at Duke Hemsworth's Estate to visit Lady Lune and and savor a nice cup of tea. You are sad that Kathryn is selling the farm and are going to miss her terribly when she moves back to the East Coast.</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>Philip, the Hemsworth Estate groundskeeper, is writing a paper on the history of the town for his college English course. He came to you one day and worked out a deal - you do the research he needs, and he <i>keeps you company</i> on lonely nights. He is beautiful, and you are single... In the back of your mind, though, you know he is only using you.</p><p>As you dug deeper into the history of Cedar Grove, you uncovered an interesting story about the previous owner of the Hemsworth Estate discovered a gold vein on the property. With a little more research using that new-fangled Internet thing you figured out that the farmer died before mining the gold, and it could still be buried on the land. You called the one nephew you have in real estate to come and buy the farm from Kathryn and sell it to you for a small profit. You like Kathryn, but the thought of such a great deal of money and a life outside this town is too tempting. Besides, with the Duke announcing his proprietor, perhaps you could introduce yourself to the suiter. The single life isn't so bad, after all.</p>"

            "whoYouAre": "<p>You have come from New York to Minnesota on business. Business is your life and your cell phone is permanently in your hand. As a land development consultant, you've been hired by the state of Minnesota to find an inexpensive tract of land to develop into a low-cost housing project.</p><p>When you are not working (a rare occurrence) you enjoy hitting the clubs. You are young and energetic and quite charismatic. The ladies tend to fawn over you, but you suspect that is because of the 2.6 million dollars you made last year in land development. If you can pull off this job for the state of Minnesota, you may even become a partner in your firm. Unfortunately, the state has given you a minuscule budget with which to acquire and develop the land. It was almost a dream-come-true to find Duke Hemsworth's Estate available under the current market value. Lady Lune's misfortune was your good fortune. You hoped that she would see that your mission was for a good cause and give you an even better deal.</p><p>You arrived today without an appointment. You saw the real estate listing in the newspaper and rushed right over.</p><p>You have spend much of the day surveying the Hemsworth Farm and have sketched a map of the area. (Receive map when arriving at party.)</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>You are not Michael Nightshade, land developer. You are Michael Nightshade, junior executive trainee at a real estate brokerage firm in New York City. You do not have millions of dollars, but you are charismatic and can easily convince others that you are made of money.</p><p>You have never been to Minnesota before which is exactly why your Aunt Monica Lawless insisted you come. You know that she is crazy, and she wouldn't give you exact details, but she told you that there would be a lot of money in it for you if you could get Lady Lune to sell the farm to you - and you sell it in turn to her. Monica insisted, however, that you keep her identity and your relationship to her a secret. But why?</p>"

            "whoYouAre": "<p>You grew up in the same city (Jersey City, New Jersey) as Kathryn Lune, who it turns out is now has the title \"Lady\" at the Hemsworth Estates. It was through her that you met her sister, Vicki. You and Vicki instantly fell in love and eloped as soon as she turned 18. You currently work - are overworked actually - as a real estate broker in New York City. You and Vicki have decided to take a vacation to get away from the hustle and bustle of your daily lives and maybe even fall in love all over again.</p><p>For the last week, you have been traveling around the country in your new RV. You arrived at the Hemsworth Estates yesterday to visit your sister-in-law.</p><p>In your spare time, you are an amateur ornithologist. You almost never go without your binoculars and look forward to looking around the Duke's Estate for interesting birds.</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>You feel trapped in your current life. You married Vicki so young... Actually, you first dated her sister, Kathryn. Kathryn would not let you get past first base with her. Her sister, Vicki, on the other hand, was quite different - she exuded sexuality. It was not long before Vicki seduced you. After Vicki became pregnant, however, you eloped and have been with her ever since. You know that Vicki stole you from Kathryn, it tore the two apart and they have not spoken since.</p><p>You travel around with your binoculars to look at birds, but use the binoculars for so much more. You and Vicki are not close at all, so you must get your sexual thrills whatever way you can - a little voyeurism here, an affair there... As for this vacation, it is not really a vacation at all. You are currently on administrative leave from your job as a real estate broker for sexually harassing the office receptionist. To make matters worse, you now have no way to cover up the evidence that you have been skimming money from your real estate transactions (Vicki lives way beyond your means - man, you hate her). You have kept the sexual harassment suit and the skimming from the company a secret from Vicki. You told her that you need money for gambling debts. You had to sell your house to return most of the money to the company, but it isn't enough. Times are getting desparate.</p><p>Your hope was to visit Kathryn and ask for a loan to get through the next couple of months. Or maybe even to get her to fall in love with you again. Whatever it takes...</p>"

            "whoYouAre": "<p>You are the (one year) younger sister of Kathryn. As a child, you adored your older sister and were the best of friends. As she grew older, however, and discovered boys, the two of you drifted apart from each other. When Kathryn married Robert and moved to Minnesota, you lost touch completely. After graduating high school, you married your high school sweetheart, Sherwin, and remained in your hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey. Currently you are a part time homemaker taking care of your three boys and also work part time at the make-up counter of the mall's department store. You are hopelessly addicted to daytime soap operas and talk shows. Your claim to fame is that you once appeared on the Gery Springger Show - the episode titled \"What I'd Do For a Buck\" is still the talk of the beauty shop.</p><p>You and Sherwin have been traveling around the country in your new RV. Yesterday, you arrived at Duke Hemsworth's Estates. You were hoping to take this opportunity to build a better relationship with your sister.</p>",
            "secrets": "<p>Kathryn has not spoken to you in years - ever since you stole her high school boyfriend, Sherwin. You hated the fact that she was in love with Shwerwin and stopped spending time with you. Not only did Kathryn despise you for stealing Shwerwin from her, but your parents resented it as well. At age 18 you secretly eloped with Sherwin and have lived with him ever since. You do not love Sherwin, but with three kids and no college education, you feel trapped. Sherwin, unfortunately, is an insecure loser. He has a gambling problem, and owes money to some very powerful people. You have a plan to get out of this terrible situation, though. You have decided to drop by on Kathryn and tell her that Sherwin was abusive to you in hopes of getting a loan, dumping dumb Sherwin, and moving out on your own - perhaps to California and become a soap opera actress... no... soap opera diva!</p>"
